===== 
Awesome WM Copycats
===== 
A collection of heavy modded themes for Awesome WM 3.5+ 
---------

Beware! They're more awesome than they appear, it's just they're shy.

Notable features:

- Autohide widgets (*tell me only when you have to*)
- Autostart functionality
- Fast mpd and volume shortcuts (first time you see this trick in Awesome)
- Other fancy shortcuts for copying to the clipboard (goodbye clipboard managers!), toggle wiboxes, widgets popups, screenshots capture, moving clients
- Quake style dropdown terminal
- Calendar with current day highlighted and previous/next month switch with just a click 
- Elegant notifications for new mails, current song, hdd critical state, low battery
- Yahoo Weather integration 
- A net carrier status notifier 
- Full localization potential (just easily edit about 5 lines - look for 'stub' keywords)
- Colorful autoupdating icons
- Symbolic tag names
- PNG taskbar

They're scattered all over the set, but you can get them all *only* in Blackburn.

Notes
--------
**Do not** use without reading and modifying according to your preferences and system specs.

Fonts are Terminus (Multicolor, Powerarrow Darker) and Tamsyn (Steamburn, Blackburn).

Blackburn uses Icons_ and Yawn_: **if you're running Ubuntu**, be sure to have bitmaps_ enabled.

Steamburn and Blackburn have X colorschemes too. Check here_.

**Have any suggestions?** did you see some great stuff and you want me to port it into Awesome? Feel free to email me, it might just be the next copycat!
